## ðŸ§  Analysis Focus

The analysis performed on this dataset focuses on several key areas:

1. **Average Ratings by Genre and Platform**:
   - How do **critic** and **player ratings** vary across different game **genres** (e.g., action, RPG, adventure)?
   - How do ratings differ based on the **platform** (e.g., PC, PlayStation, Xbox) the game was released on?

2. **Distribution Comparison**:
   - A comparison of the **distribution of average critic and player scores**, highlighting potential trends or differences between how critics and players rate games.

3. **Yearly Trend Analysis**:
   - Exploring the **average ratings** of critics and players over time, to observe how these ratings have evolved from **1998 to 2021**.

4. **Classification System: Game Quality**:
   - A **classification model** is built to predict whether a game is classified as **Good**, **Average**, or **Bad** based on selected features (e.g., platform, genre, userscore, year of release). This model allows for an exploration of what factors contribute most to a game's success or failure, according to the ratings.

5. **Classification System: Game Success Among Players**:
   - Another classification model is built to predict whether a game was considered **successful** among players based **only on the Metascore**. This analysis provides insight into the correlation between critic scores and player reception, exploring whether a higher Metascore is a reliable predictor of a game's success among its audience.
